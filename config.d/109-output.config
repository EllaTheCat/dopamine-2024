# ABSTRACTING OUTPUT NAMES -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Use config variables to abstract the output names, shell scripts need matching environment variables. I do
# not know how to apply the abstraction in 'jq' code, fortunately using literals incurs only a modest
# maintenance burden.

# OUTPUT CONFIGURATION IS DUAL MONITORS BY DEFAULT  ----------------------------------------------------

# To obtain the names of the outputs of a given machine run:

#                 swaymsg -p -t get_outputs | grep Output

# EllaTheCat obtained the same values on the same machine with two outputs (HDMI and DVI-D connectors)
# under ubuntu 22.04 LTS and fedora workstation 38: HDMI-A-1 for the right-hand side and HDMI-A-2 for
# the left-hand side. This is considered to be swapped, so outside of sway, for example in the fedora
# greeter (and on ubuntu) it is indeed swapped, and the mouse cannot cross the join between two screens,
# it must be moved offscreen at one side and back onscreen at the other side. Fedora 39 co-incides with
# a hardware reappraisal which unswaps the monitors, fixing the greeter and fixing an rpi4 sharing the
# monitors via external HDMI switches.

# WALLPAPER HOWTO --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# To make panoramic desktop wallpaper for dual displays start with an image whose dimensions slightly
# exceed or equal those of the two outputs side by side, then crop out 3840x1080 for a dual display
# using HD monitors. The Fuerteventura image is offset by 80 in X because (4000 - 3840 / 2) = 80 crops
# symmetrically in X, by 500 to crop the best 1080 pixel high stripe (ymmv).

### mogrify -crop 3840x1080+80+500! originalimage4000x2677.png

# Make and rename two copies of the cropped image, one for the left and one for the right, the right offset
# in X by the width of the left after cropping

# WHY A THIRD MONITOR
#
# There is always a temptation to use one of the monitors in a dual monitor configuration to watch a
# movie or sports. A triple monitor congiguration 5760x1080 appeals to gamers. Rotating the triple
# monitors by 90 degrees gives 3240x1920 is roughly 16:9 and might apopeal to movie watchers,  but
# would need thin bezels.
